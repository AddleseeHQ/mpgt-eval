ARI: Hello, my name is ARI. How can I help you? # greet(); inform(ari(name)); offer-help()
LC: I'm hungry. # request(food) @ G(LC, eat())
LC: I'm hungry. # request(food) @ G(LC, eat())
RP: I'm hungry. # request(food) @ G(RP, eat())
LC: I'd like to eat. # request(food) @ G(LC, eat())
ARI: It's the most important question of the day. Are you hungry yet? # inform(food) @ AG(LC, eat()); AG(RP, eat())
RP: Yes. # affirm() @ G(RP, eat())
ARI: You can ask my colleague in the room who is responsible for the meals. # inform(food) @ AG(LC, eat()); AG(RP, eat())
LC: I'd like to go to the toilet before the consultation. # request(location(toilet)) @ G(LC, go-to(toilet))
ARI: Very easy! You have to go to the corridor at the end of the room. It's the second door on the right. # inform(directions(toilet)) @ AG(LC, go-to(toilet))
