ARI: You'll have several appointments with different health professionals, at least three. First, a nurse will ask you questions about your health and carry out an initial assessment of your current condition. Next, you will discuss your difficulties with a neuropsychologist who will suggest tests to assess your abilities as accurately as possible. Then, you will see a geriatrician who will summarise all this data and suggest different types of follow-up depending on your results. # inform(appt(general_info))
