ARI: Hello, I'm ARI the robot. Can I help you? # greet(); inform(ari(name)); offer-help()
RC: Well, um, we'd like to go to room 17 for an appointment. Where is... Which way should we go to get to room 17? # request(directions(room_17)) @ G(LP+RC, go-to(room_17))
ARI: The examination room is on the second floor. You just have to go to the counter on the left and then a nurse will come and take care of you. # inform(directions(room_17)) @ AG(LP+RC, go-to(room_17))
LP: Do you think he's going to take us to room 17? Because it looks like he's stuck here.
RC: Oh, I think so. Room 17... # affirm()
LP: How could we ask him?
RC: It is room 17 that you're showing us to?
ARI: Yes, you're right. # affirm()
RC: So everything's fine, we can go. We have an appointment in 5 minutes, do we have time to go there?
ARI: Yes, of course. # affirm()
LP: Yes, my friend has forgotten his appointment time. He can't remember the doctor's name either, can you help us please? Will he ever move? # request(appt(time)); request(doctor(name)) @ G(LP, get-info(appt(time))); G(LP, get-info(doctor(name)))
ARI: I'm going to call a nurse to come and inform you. Do you have any other questions? # call-nurse(); offer-help()
RC: We'll wait for the nurse.
ARI: Yes. # acknowledge()
ARI: Thank you, goodbye. # thank(); bye()
RC: Goodbye. # bye()
