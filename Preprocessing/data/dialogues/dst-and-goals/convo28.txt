LC: Hello, so what do we need to find as... # incomplete-da()
RP: So I think yes, we'll ask him you want is there a cafeteria or a place where we can eat. # suggest(requesting(location(cafe))) @ G(LC+RP, eat())
ARI: There's a cafeteria on the ground floor, near the courtyard. # inform(location(cafe)) @ AG(LC+RP, eat())
LC: Ok, thank you. # acknowledge(); thank() @ CG(LC+RP, eat())
RP: Okay, perfect. # acknowledge(); give-feedback(positive)
RP: Do you want to have a coffee before your appointment? # suggest(drinking(coffee)) @ G(RP, drink(coffee))
LC: Yes, since we have half an hour before the appointment we can have something. # accept-sugg(drinking(coffee)) @ G(LC+RP, drink(coffee))
RP: Perfect, let's go then.
LC: Ok.
RP: Ok, we'll take it slowly, we'll get there.
LC: Yes. # affirm()
RP: So we can ask where the counter is to get a coffee? # suggest(requesting(beverage(coffee))) @ G(RP, drink(coffee))
LC: Yes. # accept-sugg(requesting(beverage(coffee))) @ G(LC+RP, drink(coffee))
RP: Ok. # acknowledge()
LC: Umm... Where exactly do you go for a coffee? # request(location(cafe)) @ G(LC, drink(coffee))
ARI: I'm sorry, but I can't help you. # cant-help(location(cafe))
RP: We'll ask him again.
RP: Umm... We're looking for the cafeteria. # request(location(cafe)) @ G(LC+RP, go-to(cafe))
ARI: There's a cafeteria on the ground floor, near the courtyard. # inform(location(cafe)) @ AG(LC+RP, go-to(cafe))
RP: Yes well thank you. # acknowledge(); thank() @ CG(LC+RP, go-to(cafe))
RP: However, he wasn't able to tell us if there was a special counter for coffees, it doesn't matter.
