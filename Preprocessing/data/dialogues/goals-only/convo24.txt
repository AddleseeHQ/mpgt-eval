ARI: Hello, my name is ARI. How can I help you?
RP: Can you ask if there is a cafeteria? Because I'd really like a coffee before the consultation. @ G(RP, go-to(cafe)); G(RP, drink(coffee))
LC: Yes.
LC: Um hello, could you tell me the address um where the cafeteria is? Because my friend would like to get something. @ G(LC, go-to(cafe))
