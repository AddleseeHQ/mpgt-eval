LP: Well it's my first time here, I don't know if this is the case for you. I'd really like to um... to be able, to be able to eat a little bit before going to my appointment, do you know where that is? @ G(LP, eat())
RC: You have a good idea...
LP: So um, is it...
RC: But I don't know where we eat, so what do I do? What do I do?
LP: So, can we eat? Is there a designated area for visitors? @ G(LP+RC, eat())
RC: Before lunch, I'd like to have breakfast. So where can we go? @ G(RC, eat(breakfast))
LP: Well, no idea.
RC: We'll ask the question.
LP: I have no idea where. First of all, if it's open to outsiders.
RC: I don't know.
LP: So um...
RC: We'll ask him.
RC: I don't know what your name is. Can you give us information and tell us what your name is? @ G(LP+RC, get-info(ari(name)))
ARI: Hello, my name is ARI. @ AG(LP+RC, get-info(ari(name)))
RC: Where's the cafeteria? @ G(RC, go-to(cafe))
ARI: How can I help you?
ARI: There are a few options available as part of your visit, and there's also a cafeteria on the ground floor. @ AG(RC, go-to(cafe))
RC: On the ground floor.
LP: And how do we get to the cafeteria? @ G(LP+RC, go-to(cafe))
ARI: You have to enter the second building behind you. Then it's the second door on the left. @ AG(LP+RC, go-to(cafe))
LP: The second building, um... Do we take do we take the walkway?
ARI: Yes.
RC: I'd really like to know what we can eat. I want a croissant and a large white coffee. @ G(LP+RC, eat()); G(RC, eat(croissant)); G(RC, drink(coffee))
ARI: Today we have an endive salad to start, followed by a ham and cheese escalope with a side of mashed potato and a fruit compote for dessert. @ AG(LP+RC, eat()); AG(RC, eat(croissant)); AG(RC, drink(coffee))
LP: Yes, that's for lunch. We would like a snack, wouldn't we? Grab a coffee or breakfast, since we're early for our appointment. @ G(LP+RC, eat(snack)); G(LP+RC, drink(coffee)); G(LP+RC, eat(breakfast))
ARI: Of course.
RC: And I'd really like to go to the toilet too. @ G(RC, go-to(toilet))
RC: Can you tell us where the toilets are? @ G(LP+RC, go-to(toilet))
ARI: Very easy! You have to go to the corridor at the end of the room. It's the second door on the right. @ AG(LP+RC, go-to(toilet))
RC: Second door on the right. Oh well, we'll find it.
LP: Next to so it's next to the cafeteria? @ G(LP+RC, go-to(toilet))
ARI: Absolutely. @ AG(LP+RC, go-to(toilet))
RC: I feel like it's further away. That, that's not on the ground floor.
LP: I'm having difficulty understanding what he's saying. I can't hear very well.
ARI: Very easy! You have to go to the corridor at the end of the room. It's the second door on the right. @ AG(LP+RC, go-to(toilet))
LP: In the corridor at the end of the room, on which side? @ G(LP, go-to(toilet))
RC: We'll let it go.
LP: We'll leave it, we'll leave it.
RC: We're going to eat something already. I'm very hungry. @ G(LP+RC, eat())
RC: Do you think it's still time? Until what time is breakfast served? @ G(RC, eat(breakfast))
ARI: Yes. @ AG(RC, eat(breakfast))
ARI: Sorry, I don't have this information.
LP: Um so, if I've understood correctly, the toilets are next to the cafeteria.
ARI: Absolutely.
LP: I'm having a hard time hearing actually.
RC: Could you speak a little louder?
ARI: I'm afraid I can't help you.
RC: You can't help us, so what are we going to do? We'll see something else maybe.
LP: So um...
LP: So maybe we'll go and have a look. Ah yes but well I think I've forgotten my sheet.
LP: I know I have an appointment but I don't know what time it's at. How can I find out my appointment time? @ G(LP, get-info(appt(time)))
ARI: I'm afraid I can't help you.
RC: Well, firstly do you know where to find um which doctor it is, which department, which specialty.
LP: Is there a reception? @ G(LP, go-to(reception))
ARI: You'll have several appointments with different health professionals, at least three. First, a nurse will ask you questions about your health and carry out an initial assessment of your current condition. Next, you will discuss your difficulties with a neuropsychologist who will suggest tests to assess your abilities as accurately as possible. Then, you will see a geriatrician who will summarise all this data and suggest different types of follow-up depending on your results.
LP: Um, how do I know what time my appointment is? @ G(LP, get-info(appt(time)))
ARI: Sorry, I don't have this information.
LP: Um... And... And where is um... Um, I, I remember, I think it's room 17. But I'm not sure. Where is room 17? @ G(LP, go-to(room_17))
ARI: You continue along the building, take the lift and it's on the second floor. @ AG(LP, go-to(room_17))
LP: And you arrive directly in room 17? @ G(LP, go-to(room_17))
ARI: Of course. @ AG(LP, go-to(room_17))
RC: Maybe it's at the reception. Maybe there's a service, a receptionist who will let you know who will tell you. @ G(RC, go-to(reception))
LP: So my appointment time will be confirmed in room 17? @ G(LP, get-info(appt(place)))
ARI: Thank you. See you around. Have a nice day.
RC: Thank you.
LP: Have a nice day.
