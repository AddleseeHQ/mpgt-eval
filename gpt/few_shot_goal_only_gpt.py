If the person's goal can be determined by that turn, add an '@' symbol followed by 'G' (G for goal), and then brackets with the speaker ID and what their goal is. If it is a shared goal, you can annotate both speakers with a '+' sign between them. For example, if you think LC and RP share the goal, you can write LC+RP. If you think the goal is being answered, you can do the same but with 'AG' (AG for Answer Goal) instead of 'G'. Finally, if you think the person is closing the goal, you can do the same annotation using 'CG' (CG for Close Goal) instead of 'G' or AG'. Here are some examples. " + src

Let's step through how to figure out the correct annotation. If the conversation included 'LC: I really need the toilet [MASK]', then we would first know that the speaker is called LC. The turn also ends with [MASK], so we know that we need to replace it with a goal. We know that LC needs the toilet, so their goal is to go to the nearest toilet. Goals always begin with the '@' symbol, and then a 'G' if we have found a person's goal. We would therefore replace [MASK] with @ G(LC, go-to(toilet)). If someone tells LC where the toilets are, they have answered their goal. We would therefore annotate that turn with @ AG(LC, go-to(toilet)). We use AG here to indicate Answer Goal. Finally, if LC then said thank you, we know their goal has been met. We would annotate the thank you with @ CG(LC, go-to(toilet)) because LC's goal is finished. CG stands for Close Goal. Do this goal tracking for each [MASK] in this conversation. Here are some examples. " + src
